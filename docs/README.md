# Arc Jumpstart Drop: Using KAITO with AKS Azure Arc

## Introduction

Welcome to the Arc Jumpstart Drop for integrating KAITO with AKS Azure Arc. This guide is designed to provide a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to deploying KAITO on AKS clusters enabled by Azure Arc. Our mission is to help you get started quickly and efficiently, leveraging the power of KAITO and Azure Arc to enhance your AI and machine learning workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* An Azure subscription with access to AKS and Azure Arc.
* A GPU-enabled VM in your Azure subscription.
* Access to the CI lab tenant for testing (if applicable).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Create an AKS Cluster**: Deploy an AKS cluster in your Azure subscription. Ensure that the cluster is Arc-enabled.
2. **GPU Node Configuration**: Verify that your AKS cluster has access to GPU nodes. If you encounter quota issues, request GPU quota relief through the appropriate channels.

### Step 2: Deploying KAITO

1. **Clone the KAITO Repository**: Clone the KAITO repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies for KAITO. This includes Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm.
3. **Deploy KAITO**: Use Helm to deploy KAITO on your AKS cluster. Ensure that the deployment is successful and that KAITO is running smoothly.

### Step 3: Configuring KAITO

1. **Set Up Configuration Files**: Configure KAITO with the appropriate settings for your environment. This includes specifying the GPU nodes and any other relevant parameters.
2. **Test Deployment**: Run tests to ensure that KAITO is functioning correctly. Verify that the AI models are running on the GPU nodes and that the performance is optimal.

### Step 4: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Monitor Performance**: Use Azure Monitor and other tools to keep track of KAITO's performance. Ensure that the GPU nodes are being utilized effectively.
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep KAITO and your AKS cluster updated with the latest patches and improvements. Regularly check for updates and apply them as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **GPU Quota Issues**: If you encounter GPU quota issues, request quota relief through the appropriate channels. Ensure that your subscription has access to the necessary GPU resources.
* **Deployment Failures**: If KAITO fails to deploy, check the configuration files and ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly. Refer to the logs for more details on the errors.
